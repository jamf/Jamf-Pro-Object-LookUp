# This script is designed to be run that will query the Jamf Pro server and a list of the following
# 	- objects in a macOS Policy such as Packages, Scripts, and Printers
# 	- packages within a macOS Patch Management Policy
# 	- Items a macOS Group is assigned to or excluded from such as Policies, Patch Polcies, Profiles, Restricted Software and MacOS Apps as well as nested smart groups
# 	- Items a Mobile Device Group is assigned to or excluded from such as Profiles and Mobile Device Apps as well as nested smart groups
#
#
#	Once completed there will be a text file on the users desktop in the format of "OBJECT_NAME.day.month.year.txt"
#	for example Test_Group.25.09.2019.txt
